# CSC430 Lab 6
A VueJS Machine Learning Application! :D

## Deviations from [Microsoft's Lesson](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-web-app-with-refreshable-models/):
 - Some code was changed in order to use newer versions of some packages.
 - A critical bug with VueJS 3 was fixed by [a helpful post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67815952/vue3-app-with-tensorflowjs-throws-typeerror-cannot-read-property-backend-of-u) on StackOverflow.
 - Instead of [hosting the frontend on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-web-app-with-refreshable-models/8-publish-deploy-github-action) (it costs money, booo!), it will be hosted on a github page (coming soon!)
