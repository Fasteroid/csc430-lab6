# CSC430 Lab 6
### A VueJS Machine Learning Application

## Setup
 - Clone the project and run `npm run serve` !

## Deviations
 - One image from each dataset was deleted due to being in the wrong file format.
 - Images are chosen randomly now.
 - Some code was changed in order to use newer versions of some packages.
 - A critical bug with VueJS 3 was fixed by [a helpful post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67815952/vue3-app-with-tensorflowjs-throws-typeerror-cannot-read-property-backend-of-u) on StackOverflow.
 - Instead of [hosting with Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-web-app-with-refreshable-models/8-publish-deploy-github-action), I opted for [Github Pages](https://fasteroid.github.io/csc430-lab6/)
